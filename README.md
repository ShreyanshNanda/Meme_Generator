#Meme_Generator #Frontend #WebDevelopment
The idea here is to use an API to fetch random meme images and then allow users to place custom text at the top and bottom of the image.
Added two different input fields in meme generator, i.e.
1st one is for the text at the top and the
2nd one is for the text at the bottom of the image.
